    <h1 id="chai-a-simple-erc20-wrapper-over-the-dai-savings-rate">syUSD â€“ A stablecoin wrapper over yUSD</h1>
<p>Today I am excited to introduce syUSD, it is an ERC20 token that lets you wrap yUSD into a stable currency. This allows for users to have a constantly increasing (as long as yUSD is still chugging along) stable coin balance in their wallet. It can be transfered freely and is always redeemable for the amount of yUSD that was deposited to mint the syUSD. Interact with the syUSD contract at <a href="https://syusd.cash">syUSD.cash</a>.</p>
<p>syUSD lives on the Ethereum mainnet at address  <code>0x20bef22f92fd1c2d50765c0d26f5a238219e1c1a</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-yusd-">What is yUSD?</h2>
<p>yUSD is an ERC-20 token issued by Yearn that represents shares in our most popular vault: the yCRV Vault. yUSD makes DeFi simple by automatically maximizing yield and minimizing risk for our depositors. On the backend, the yCRV Vault implements modular, autonomous, yield-aware strategies. These are created and regularly updated by the best minds in DeFi, all under the control of Yearn governance.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-syusd-">So then what is syUSD?</h2>
<p>syUSD is a stablecoin wrapper for yUSD. yUSD is currently trading at about $1.15 when this site went live and has slowly increased in price over time. syUSD allows users to deposit their yUSD to recieve syUSD. syUSD will be contantly updating users balances and the totalSupply to track $1 based on the underlying assets in yUSD. </p>
<h3 id="yusd-deposits-and-withdrawals">yUSD-denominated mint and burn</h3>
<p>To mint syUSD, a user must approve the syUSD contract address and then call mint with the amount of yUSD they desire to lock up. This will mint the user an appropriate amount of syUSD. Likewise, to burn your syUSD and get back out yUSD, the user must call burn with the amount of yUSD they desire to get back out. At any time the user can check their underlying yUSD balance through the function balanceOfUnderlying.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The deployed `syUSD` contract is EXTREMELY experimental and requires intense scruitiny from other developers before I would recommend anyone puts their money into it. Please use at your own risk. </p>
